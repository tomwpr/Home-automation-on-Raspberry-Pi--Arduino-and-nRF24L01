Home-automation-on-Raspberry-Pi--Arduino-and-nRF24L01
=====================================================

My simple home automation project made on Raspberry Pi and Arduino Nano with nRF24L01 modules. I use here some push buttons too to turn on/off lights and motion sensors to turn on/off light on motion detection. You will need also RF24 drivers to run nRF24L01 2.4GHz modules.
